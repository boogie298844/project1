   <div class="main-content">Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza place!
     A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life.
     HAVING PIZZASTATSTIC FUN SINCE 1972
     However, due to a number of incidents, sanctions by the Health Department over the numerous reports of dirtiness, and "The Bite of '87" - the pizzeria has fallen on hard times. Freddy Fazbear's Pizza is set to close by the end of the year, as potential buyers do not want to be associated with the tainted reputation of the company HOWEVER, WE ARE STILL OPEN, AND LOVE OUR CUSTOMERS! The four mascots - Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox -  concerned SOME parents however CHIDREN LOVE THEM!  They havent had a bath in their 20+ years of service, which would explain the nasty odor. Due to the risk of their servos locking up from disuse, the animatronics have been left in a "free roaming mode" at night over the years. They used to be able to roam freely during the day as well, but The Bite of '87 prompted to put a stop to this. BUT THE SHOWS CONTINUE!  BRING YOUR KIDS IN TODAY!
